      <h3> About Me! </h3>
        <p> Hi! My name is Jordyn and this is my digital resume. I've created
            a this space as a way to showcase both my professional and creative career
            thus far. Born and raised in Harlem, NYC, I call many different states & cities
            my home. I lived in Harlem until I began to attend boarding school in East
            Hampton from 7-12th grade. Currently, I live in Long Beaach, California when
            I'm not in Miami for the school semester. During the summer, I visit my 3-year old half-sister Milyana in Nice, France.
            <!-- This is the reason as to why I decided to minor in French. -->
             So, I like to think of myself as a "modern" nomad if you will.</p>
